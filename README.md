**Next NProgress Bar and NProgress V2 become BProgress!**

**BProgress** is a modern reimplementation of **NProgress** in **TypeScript, featuring optimized syntax, better customization, and improved performance**. Unlike NProgress, which has been unmaintained for over five years, BProgress **follows modern best practices and includes new community-requested features**. Its goal is to simplify progress bar integration across multiple frameworks with dedicated packages. ðŸš€

## Why is BProgress useful?

**BProgress** is a lightweight progress bar designed to visually indicate loading states in web applications. It is commonly used to display a **smooth, animated progress bar** during **page transitions, data loading, or asynchronous operations**.

It helps users understand that a new page or content is being loaded, making navigation more intuitive and preventing confusion during transitions.
