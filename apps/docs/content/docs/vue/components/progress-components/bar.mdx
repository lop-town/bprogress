description: Use the `Bar` component
---

The `Bar` component must be used inside the `Progress` component.

## Import

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Bar } from '@lop-town/bprogress-...';
</script>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Replace the `...` in the import with the library you're using. For example, if you use `@lop-town/bprogress-nuxt`, import by doing `from '@lop-town/bprogress-nuxt'`
</Callout>

## Usage

The `Bar` component is used to create the progress bar element.

```vue
<template>
  <Bar />
</template>
```

It can also be used with a slot to insert a child component (like a custom component) as follows:

```vue
<template>
  <Bar>
    <Peg />
  </Bar>
</template>
```
